## Projects

### [Coffee Recommendation Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/nikita-patel378/caffeinatedgraph)
- Developed a knowledge graph to identify similarities between coffee blends and support personalized recommendations.  
- Utilized Neo4j, Selenium for web scraping, and GraphRAG for data insights.  
- Demonstrated how graph databases can enhance customer experience and decision-making.  

### [Shoe Mileage Tracker](https://github.com/nikita-patel378/shoedataintoneo4j)
- Migrated activity data from PostgreSQL to Neo4j to evaluate graph databases for tracking multi-dog activities and shoe mileage.  
- Gained insights into the suitability of graph databases versus relational databases for specific use cases.  

### [Text Classification for Keanu Reeves' Character Traits Using spaCy](https://github.com/nikita-patel378/keanutraitclassification)
- Built a text classification model to analyze Keanu Reeves' characters based on movie plot summaries.  
- Utilized spaCy’s LLM model and standard text classification techniques to assign one or more of six traits to each character: Badass, Adventurous, Unapologetic, Romantic, Free-Spirited, and Relentless.  
- Cleaned and filtered data using plot summaries from the TMDB API, removing irrelevant entries like documentaries or summaries lacking a clear reference to Keanu Reeves' character.  
- Highlighted the use of NLP techniques to gain insights into character archetypes and thematic trends.
